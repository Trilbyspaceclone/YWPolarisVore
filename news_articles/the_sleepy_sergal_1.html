===Unathi Black Egg Plague At Record High! (powered by Nanotrasen®™)===
<br>
The Hegemony High Council has released a statement today confirming what has been circulating amongst the circles of the unathi population: Black Egg Syndrome has been at an all time high, at thirteen percent and rising.
For readers who are unaware, this is a condition that mainly targets unathi females, sympthoms include unathi egg clutches including one or several eggs which are covered in a dark, hard, leather like substance, which makes hatching for the young skinks next to impossible thanks to how solid the egg is compared to normal. Often times this will result in the egg being left for dead in the wild, and the female is reclassified as male due to their cultural value decreasing. 
<br>
Beyond confirming what was suspected, Hegemony, as well as Solgov officals, have declined to comment. Skrellian officals, meanwhile, have remarked that they would seek a cure for this deliberating condition, as a token of goodwill after the war years earlier involving the Hegemony, Skrell, and Solgov.

Obituary - Pablo Jenner
<br>
Pablo Jenner passed away while fighting giant space bears during a mining expedition on the evening of October 10th, 2563, at the age of 76. He will be greatly missed for his service. He has lived a rich life of mining on various planets and moons, and continued on even after losing his legs to other creatures, he was a real trooper.
<br>
His last words were to a certain Margaret and it said: "Tell her she's a bitch."
<br>
Respects can be paid at the Yawn Wider Colony, where his remains are currently kept.

===Tragic Tram Crash on Virgo 3B!  (powered by Nanotrasen®™) ===
<br>
Tragic news from Virgo 3B today. The orange line tram's automated brakes failed to engage when arriving at one of the waystations on the route. The resulting crash ended up destroying the small station's tram terminal, as well as the tram car itself. The automated systems however, did not pick up on the crash until much later, reporting that the train was still moving as normal. It wasn't until crewmembers aboard the next stop on the line, Yawn Wider Station, noticed that the tram was mysteriously missing, that technicians realized what had happened. 
<br>
The tram contained two passengers, Sabel Hall, 34, Human; and Farket Mrrhalka, 21, Tajara. Only Sabel's body has been located at this time, though the explosion, coupled with the harsh environment, leads investigators to presume that Farket was also killed. 
<br>
A memorial service will be conducted for the victims of the tragic accident on their home colony. In the meantime, technicians begun repairs on the orange line, and, in the meantime, workers should use short range teleporters, or a different tram line, to make it to and from their workplace
